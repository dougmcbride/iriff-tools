This is a place to open-source my tools for iRiff creators.  Coming
soon, the code for my iRiffs Facebook app.  For now, an IRC bot
which will monitor your iRiffs' vitals for you.

<shamelessplug> Team Swizzlebeef
( http://www.rifftrax.com/iriffs/team-swizzlebeef ) has been using
it happily for a while now. </shamelessplug>

~/Projects/iriff-tools/irc (master)$ ruby riffbot.rb --help
Usage: riffbot.rb [options]
    -u, --username USERNAME          Specify rifftrax.com username.
    -w, --password PASSWORD          Specify rifftrax.com password.
    -c, --channel NAME               Specify IRC channel to /join. (test)
    -f, --full-name NICK             Specify the bot's IRC full name. (iRiff report bot)
    -n, --nick NICK                  Specify the bot's IRC nick. (riffbot)
    -s, --server HOST                Specify IRC server hostname. (irc.freenode.net)
    -p, --port NUMBER                Specify IRC port number. (6667)
    -t, --top-50                     Actively report top 50 rankings (they twitch a lot).
    -l, --logging LEVEL              Logging level (debug, info, warn, error, fatal) (warn)
    -i, --interval MINUTES           Number of minutes to sleep between checks (5)
    -h, --help                       Display this screen

Some of these have useful defaults, but at a minimum you'll want
to supply --username, --password, --channel, and --server.

In order to gather the stats, the bot:

 - logs in as you

 - scrapes your product page (/user/<your userid>/selling) to get
   the edit page URLs

 - visits these edit pages and scrapes the youtube sample URLs

 - visits youtube.com and scrapes the view count on the sample and
   the number of referrals from rifftrax.com

 - visits the sales report page (/user/<your userid>/selling/reports/product)
   and scrapes the view count, sales number, and total $ for each product

 - visits the main iriff page (/iriffs) to get the ranking for each
   product, if any
 

I'd like to get the rating information for products, but that only
seems to exist on the product page, and every hit on that page
counts as a view, even if you're logged in and it's your product.
This is also why I don't just get the youtube sample URL from the
product page.

The script enforces a minimum wait time of 5 minutes in between
checks.  Please DO NOT decrease this out of respect for rifftrax.com's
servers.  A few of us checking every five minutes shouldn't put a
dent in their traffic.

Once the bot joins your channel, you can tell it:

  riff report (or .)

    Start polling if you haven't already, and report the latest
    stats.  From this point on the bot will report any changes in
    stats that it finds.

  riff top50 (or .50)

    Toggle active reporting of the Top 50 list ranking for products.
    I have this off by default as our products seems to have different
    rankings every time the page is loaded, and this creates a lot
    of chatter.

  riff interval <m> (or .i <m>)

    Change the polling interval to m minutes.
